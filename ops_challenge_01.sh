# Objectives:
# [X] Copy /var/log/syslog to the current working directory
# [X] Appends the current date and time to the filename
# Extra:
# [X] Include in your bash script some timestamped echo statements telling the user what is happening at each stage of the script.

TIMESTAMP="$(date +"%B_%d_%Y_%R")" # Formats date as full month name, day of month, year, time (24 hour)

    # This script works well enough as is using cp, but I wanted to try using rsync. I could not get rsync to accept time parameter, I get the following error: rsync error: unexplained error (code 255) at io.c(228) [sender=3.2.3]
    # command rsync -a -P /var/log/syslog "${destination}" # Uses rsync to copy /var/log/syslog to current active directory located in destination variable
    # rsync synchronizes files and directories between two locations and copies files to local and remote locations.
    # -a recursively copies directories, transfers special and block devices and preserves symbolic links, modification times, group, ownership, and permissions.
    
    getTime="$(date +"%r")" # Gets current local time
    echo -e "\nCopy complete at ${getTime}" # Lets user know the task is complete and gives time complete in 12 hour format
    echo -e "\n"
